## Review of the `deposits` package for R

[`deposits`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/deposits) allows you to deposit data into the generalist repositories [figshare](https://figshare.com/)
and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). 

It guides users through the creation of descriptive metadata using [dublin core metadata inititaive (DCMI) terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) and provides a unified programmatic interface for uploading and accessing items
from both services. 

The deposits package aims to integrate seamlessly with [`frictionless`](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) data package
frame work. The frictionless framework contains both structural and descriptive
metadata. Deposits focuses on producing high quality descriptive metadata.


## Getting started

Generally, for testing purposes the zenodo-sandbox service is used.
