## Review From Session 1

**Reproducibility** is the ability to re-create results from the same data and code

**Basic Guidance**:  
1. Use an IDE like Rstudio   
2. Always start from a blank slate (save source not sessions)  
3. Use projects and relative paths  
4. Keep your code organized (avoid spaghetti code)  
5. Leave yourself notes (literate programming) 

::: notes
Working from the same definition for reproducibility,  Today's session will focus on using GIT and Github to help us manage  code  and make it available to collaborators. It builds directly the basic guidance we laid out during the first session - with a particular emphasis on source over session.

## Problem statement

Writing code for research purposes involves exploring data and analyses to gain understanding. It also often involves collaboration. Both collaboration and exploration can increase entropy in your code base through undocumented changes, swelling the number of files, and bespoke systems for understanding which is the correct file. 


::: notes
I am using the right file? Did we include the most up to date figure in the paper? Whats the difference between final CJS and final final NR? 
:::

## Solution

### Use a version control system:

- organize
- track
- share
- harmonize


::: notes
In order for the outputs of collaboration and exploration to be reproducible, you need to have a system for organizing, tracking, sharing, and harmonizing code. A version control system  allows you and your collaborators to document specific changes in the code, harmonize code from multiple contributors, and explore new ways of analyzing your data without ballooning the number of files.

## Version control and collabortaion with GIT and Github

*GIT* - Distributed Version Control System

*Github* - A GIT based collaboration platform and remote code repository

::: notes
At EHA we use GIT for version control and Github to facilitate collaboration

::: notes

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to collaborate with as many people as you like. It uses pointers and tree like structures to manage differences in files
and has rules for how to resolve those differences. 

:::

## Basic Terms

- **Repo**: code repository - a folder containing your code
- `branch`: a divergence from the main code base. Used for feature development,experimentation, or bug fixes. 
- `commit`: commit lets you track a change to a file, requires a message. These should be brief but informative. 
- `merge`: join two branches - harmonize your code

## How does GIT work?


```{r echo=FALSE, ph=officer::ph_location_type(type="body")}

git_df <- data.frame(from = c(1,2,4,2,3,5,4,7),
                     to = c(2,4,6,3,5,6,7,8),
                     branch = c(rep("main",3),rep("feature",3),rep("fix",2))
                     )

graph <- graph_from_data_frame(git_df) %>% 
  set_vertex_attr("commit",value = sprintf("Commit %s",c("4d52","a7da","6895","b85f","039e","85a9","0f9b")))  %>% 
  set_vertex_attr("commit_msg",value = sprintf("%s",c("First Commit","added analysis 1","Manage analysis outputs","plotting function","adding error visualization","fixed typo in file path","Merge plotting function","using here package")))



# Not specifying the layout - defaults to "auto"
graph_obj <- ggraph(graph) + 
    geom_edge_bend(aes(colour = branch), width= 10) +
    geom_node_point(size = 30) +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = commit_msg), repel = FALSE) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  coord_flip() 

dml(ggobj = graph_obj)
```

::: notes
You can think of GIT like a time line where you are taking snap shots of your code. 

Each snapshot tracks changes to files in a repository and GIT provides rules governing how those changes should be merged when timelines diverge or branch. 

:::

## What is a commit?
  

```{r echo=FALSE, ph=officer::ph_location_type(type="body")}


# Not specifying the layout - defaults to "auto"
graph_obj <- ggraph(graph) + 
    geom_edge_bend(aes(colour = branch), width= 10) +
    geom_node_point(size = 30) +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = commit), repel = FALSE) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  coord_flip() 

dml(ggobj = graph_obj)
```

:::notes

Each snapshot is created by a commit. Each commit has a unique ID, information about what branch it currently lives on, information about what changed, and (ideally) a brief informative message describing that change. 

:::

## When should you be making commits?

- Before a commit becomes hard describe with a single sentence
- After making a change to your repository that accomplishes something
- After making a change to your repository that you might want to undo

## What is a branch?

```{r echo=FALSE, ph=officer::ph_location_type(type="body")}


# Not specifying the layout - defaults to "auto"
graph_obj <- ggraph(graph) + 
    geom_edge_bend(aes(colour = branch), width= 10) +
    geom_node_point(size = 30) +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = commit_msg), repel = FALSE) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  coord_flip() 

dml(ggobj = graph_obj)
```

::: notes

Branches are splits in the timeline of your code. This is one of the best features
of git for experimentation and collaboration.

Branches allow you to add, fix, or enhance components of your repo without changing
the core code. In this example we are creating a feature branch that adds visualization
capabilities and a fix branch that corrects an issue with file paths in the analysis
output. 

:::

## When to create branches?

- After you identify a specific component of the code you would like to change
- When your changes might break things, especially for collaborators
- When you would like to add a new feature to code 

## Things to be aware of

- You might accidentally overwrite commits on `main` when you merge if you've made changes to the same file 
- Merges can have conflicts, follow the prompts given to you by git to resolve them  
- You can delete branches after you merge your code

## Things to be aware of
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

git_df2 <- data.frame(from = c(1,2,3,4,5,3,7),
                       to = c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8),
                     branch = c(rep("main",5),rep("fix",2))
                     )

graph2 <- graph_from_data_frame(git_df2) %>% 
  set_vertex_attr("commit",value = sprintf("Commit %s",c("4d52","a7da","6895","b85f","039e","85a9","0f9b","7yh3")))  %>% 
  set_vertex_attr("commit_msg",value = sprintf("%s",c("First Commit","added analysis 1","Manage analysis outputs","plotting function","adding error visualization","fixed typo in file path","Merge plotting function","using here package")))



# Not specifying the layout - defaults to "auto"
graph_obj2 <- ggraph(graph2) + 
    geom_edge_bend(aes(colour = branch), width= 10) +
    geom_node_point(size = 30) +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = commit_msg), repel = FALSE) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  coord_flip() 


dml(ggobj = graph_obj2)
```


## Typical git workflow

1. Use `status` to check your current branch and changes to tracked files
0. `pull` any changes down from remote 
1. Create or change some files
2. Use `status` to see which files changed
2. `add` files so GIT knows to include them in the commit
3. `commit` those files to preserve a certain state
4. `push` that commit to Remote

## Remote? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Princess Bride"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/FJo5gIoUYAMK67O.jpg")
```

::: notes

the remote repository is essentially the thing that connects collaborators.

## Github


:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r layout='Two Content', ph=officer::ph_location_left()}
colab_df <- data.frame(from = c(1,1),
                     to = c(2,3),
                     action = c("<<< pull <<<","<<< push <<<")
                     )

graph <- graph_from_data_frame(colab_df) %>% 
  set_vertex_attr("name",value = c("Github","Noam","Emma"))  %>% 
  set_vertex_attr("type",value = c("Remote","Human","Human"))  



# Not specifying the layout - defaults to "auto"
graph_obj_col <- ggraph(graph,layout = 
                          "tree") + 
    geom_edge_link( width= 10, aes(label = action), color = "#60a644",angle_calc = 'along') +
    geom_node_point(size = 30, aes( color = type)) +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = name), repel = FALSE) +
    scale_color_brewer(type = "qual") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

dml(ggobj = graph_obj_col)
```
:::

::: {.column}
- Acts as a remote repository 
- Allows us to communicate about code in a central location
- Facilitates complicated GIT actions

:::
::::::

::: notes

In our case - Github hosts the remote repository. In this example, Noam
and Emma are collaborating on some code and using github as an intermediary to share
that code. Emma pushes changes up to github, and Noam pulls them down. 

Emma and Noam coordinate their work through issues created on github and use
github to let each other know when branches are ready to be merged via pull requests.

## Github Tour: Code
 
  - branches
  - Readme
  - cloning/downloading
  
## Github Tour: Issues

  - new issue - labeling
  - discussion issues
  - linking issues
  
## Github Tour: Pull Requests

  - linking to issues
  - discussion
  - in code comments

## Github bells and whistles

- A lot documentation and help
- Access control to repos
- Automations with Github Actions
- Repo Templates
- Integrations with Slack, Airtable, Zenodo, Rstudio, and MANY more

::: notes

Because GIT and Github is the preferred version control system, its generally very well documented and there are a lot 
of extra features readily available.  

:::

## Github Exercise

- clone repo, create a branch, modify the readme.md file, push to github

## Aren't we supposed to be talking about reproducbility?

- Git and Github make your workflow code centric 
- It pushes you to used self contained repositorries/projects
- Through commits, pull requests, and issues you document the history of your code
- Github can make your code accessible to others
- 


## To Review

1. Use an IDE like Rstudio   
2. Always start from a blank slate (save source not sessions) 3. Use projects and relative paths  
4. Keep your code organized (avoid spaghetti code)  
5. Leave yourself notes (literate programming) 
6. Use a version control system
