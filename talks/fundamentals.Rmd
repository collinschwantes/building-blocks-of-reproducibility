# Problem statement

As scientists, reproducibility is the foundation of our work. Computers
help with reproducibility because they are great a repetitive tasks and
following instructions. However, a computer's ability to reproduce
results is most often limited by the instructions provided by humans.
  
???
Show of hands - How many of you have had trouble getting old code or
code that was shared with you to run on your computer?

Can a few people share the issues that they ran into?

These are all problems with reproducibility. Today we are going to stick
to the basics like using relative paths and project based workflows, but
eventually this series of talks will get arrive at capturing computer
environments and packing code for more complete reproducibility.

# What is reproducibility?

>The ability to re-create results from the same data and code

???
In the context of reproducible research software, reproducibility is the ability to recreate results from the same code and data.

![reproducibility matrix](`r here::here("img","reproducible-matrix.jpg")`)   


???
This tablefrom the turing-way project lays out how we will discuss different types
of results re-generation. These differ subtly from how the terms might
be used in lab or field work. So to re-iterate - we are focusing on
using the same code and same data to create the same result and calling
that reproducibility.

---
# Why do I care?  

1) Your workflows will be more efficient  
2) You can collaborate with others  
3) Your code will be ready for publication  
4) Your code can be reused (likely by you)  

???
By creating reproducible workflows you will be more efficient. For you, it will 
be easier to check that your code runs appropriately, swap in new data or parameters in analyses, and re-create figures for 
publication. 

For your colleagues, it will be easier to collaborate with you. Your code will run on their computers with minimal effort, they will be able to follow the organizational
structure and comments you added, and they will be able to contribute to your code.

Finally, for future you there are two major benefits. 1) Your code will be ready
for the publication process. Reviewers and readers will appreciate your prowess. 
2) Your code will be ready for future you to build off. It will be easier for you
to lift a function or workflow out of one project and place it directly into another
because you know what your code does and that your code will work if its moved from one folder to another or one computer to another.

# How can I make my R code more reproducible?

1)  Use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Rstudio or
    VScode  
2)  Always start from a blank slate (save source not sessions)  
3)  Use projects and relative paths  
4)  Keep your code organized (avoid spaghetti code)  
5)  Leave yourself notes (literate programming)  

???
For the rest of the time we are going to talk about how to make your R
code more reproducible but these principles apply to pretty much any
coding language you might use.

---
# What is an IDE and why should I use one?

- IDEs are designed to help you write code
- Facilitate good habits
- Provide helpful hints and shortcuts 

???
Integrated development environments are programs that make it easier to write code. It handles most of the difficult parts of configuration, allows you to create and execute self contained coding project, and facilitates good habits for creating reproducible code. 

A good IDE will also make coding and formatting code easier. 

Open .R file for demo

  ### Setup the IDE to avoid carrying items between sessions

]

.pull-right[![Not restoring data](https://rstats.wtf/img/rstudio-workspace.png)]

???
 Each time you open up Rstudio, it should be with a blank slate. That way, you know what is loaded; how data, objects, or functions were created; and you'll have a better iadea of how to address issues if something goes wrong. If items have to be shuttled between sessions in order for your analysis to run, your workflow will be extremely difficult to reproduce and could irreparably break if you accidentally overwrite or delete that precious object.

# Always start from a blank slate
### Save costly ouputs
.pull-left[![my precious](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/2cf77c3c32de9d23340c07d1c436d4b1.jpg)]

.pull-right[Explicity store and read outputs that take a long time to create

```{r eval=FALSE, }

precious_sim <- computationally_expensive_simulation(
  params, 
  iterations = 10^6
)

# Pick the appropriate formt to store it in
saveRDS(precious_sim, 
        file = here::here("outputs","precious_sim.rds")
)

precious_sim <- readRDS(file =
        here::here("outputs","precious_sim.rds") 
)
```
]

???
When an output is computationally expensive - it takes a long time or a lot of computer power to make - it makes sense to purposefully store that object and pass it along, even to use it between sessions. But that object should be explicitly stored and called from a file - it should be sourced.

# Always start from a blank slate

### Use source code to create your workflow
]
.pull-right[

Script that stores functions
```{r eval=FALSE}
#./R/create_precious.R
# get the volume of a ring
create_precious <- function(minor,major){
  ring_volume <- (2*pi*major)*(pi*minor^2)
  return(ring_volume)
}

```

Script that runs functions
```{r eval=FALSE}
# ./1_script.R
library(dplyr)
source("R/create_precious.R")

# create ring with a specific volume 
precious_obj <- create_precious(minor = 3,
                                major =  23.878027)

# save previous
write.csv(x = precious_obj,file = 
            here::here("outputs",
                       "precious_obj.csv"))

```
]

???
Use source code to define functions and create objects. This makes it much easier to recreate a workflow, pinpoint issues in code, and break code in workable chunks. 

--- 

# Always start from a blank slate
### Restart your session when you need to 

Your R sessions should be dispensable - your code should be saved. 

???
To restart your R session click Session > Restart R. This will get you back to essentially a blank slate. Any packages you had loaded will be unloaded, any items you stored in the session will be gone, and you will be free to work some section of the code.

# Use projects and relative paths  
### Projects
Project: A self-contained collection of files that provides
context for your code. 


Benefits of projects:  
1) Working directory is set for you!  
2) Easier to create self-contained code  
3) Easier to move between workflows  

???

Rstudio - like most IDEs - uses the concept of a project. Projects are a collections of files, including your source code, that describe the computer environment, R settings, and where source code - your R or Rmd scripts - live.

# Use projects and relative paths  
### Relative Paths

**Absolute Path** = precise location on **MY** computer where the file lives  
- `my/user/name/desktop/R/data_librarian/outputs/precious_obj.csv`

**Relative Path** = Location relative to current working directory where the file lives  
- `outputs/precious_obj.csv`

---
# Use projects and relative paths  
### Relative Paths

The `here` package: constructs paths relative to your project root folder

- Easy to construct complex paths
  - `here::here("outputs","reports","my_report.html")`
- Useful when making markdown reports

???

Using  projects and relative paths gets you like 80% of the way to a reproducible workflow. The here package is extremely helpful if that workflow includes rmarkdown documents because it allows you to use the same paths when running the code from console as when you knit the document.  

---
# Keep your code organized 
.pull-left[
- Use clear/common folder names 
  - `R` for rscripts
- Use clear file names
  - `R/ring_forging_functions.R`
- Use clear object names 
  - `create_one_ring <- function()`  
  
**usethis::use_r("ring_forging_functions")**
]

.pull-right[
```
--middle_earth -
    |- 1-script.R
    |
    |-R
    |   |-ring_foring_functions.R

Don't let priority effects govern your code base - think through the structure of folders so that they make sense.

# Leave yourself notes 

- Sketch out your workflow
- Provide "just in time" information to contextualize code
- Leave breadcrumbs for yourself and other users
- Add a readme file to the project and keep it up to date

# Leave yourself notes

### Advanced documentation for function

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' Get the volume of a ring
#' 
#' This function provides the volume of a torus ring.
#'
#' @param minor Numeric. radius of minor cirle
#' @param major Numeric. radius of major circle
#'
#' @return volume of torus ring
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
create_precious <- function(minor,major){
  ring_volume <- (2*pi*major)*(pi*minor^2)
  return(ring_volume)
