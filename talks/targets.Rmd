# Review from previous talks

**Reproducibility** is the ability to re-create results from the same data and code

1)  Use an IDE like Rstudio   
2)  Always start from a blank slate (save source not sessions)  
3)  Use projects and relative paths  
4)  Keep your code organized (avoid spaghetti code)  
5)  Leave yourself notes (literate programming)  
6)  Use a version control system

# Today's talk

- What is targets
- Why should I care?
- How does it fit into our reproducibility framework
- Who's already using targets?
- Demo - setting up a project with targets
  - init
  - creating targets
  - targets and RMD
  - debugging targets
  - targets and github

---

# Briefest Review of Targets

- Targets is an R package that makes analysis workflows more reproducible
- Create a set of steps and execute them. Targets figures out dependencies between steps. 
- Outputs are stored and only re-written if something changes 
-  See Noam's talk

---
# Targets and reproducibility

- Always starts from a blank slate
  - each time you run `tar_make` its run in a fresh environment BUT any objects that haven't changed will be loaded. 
- Provides a common structure for projects
  - Functions in an /R folder, packages.R, and _targets.R
- Documentation becomes easier to write because everything fits together in a specific way.

# Why use targets

1) It saves you time during complicated analyses  
2) It saves you time during project setup - project structure is predefined  
3) It helps you organize your code

# Where is `targets` being used at EHA?
- [Automated Data Quality Control for Nipah Bangladesh](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/nipah-bangladesh-automation/blob/main/_targets.R)
- [Computationally Expensive Model Builds for DTRA-ML](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/dtra-ml/blob/main/_targets.R)
- Others?

---

# Initiating Targets 
- Helpful packages: `tflow`,`tarchetypes`, `usethis`, `fnmate`
- Use `tflow::use_tflow()` to setup a minimalist and ergonomic targets workspace

```
remotes::install_github("milesmcbain/tflow")

tflow::use_tflow()

# Layout workflow in _targets.R

```
## Load your packages, e.g. library(targets).
source("./packages.R")

## Load your R files
lapply(list.files("./R", full.names = TRUE), source)

## load data
bat_data <-  tar_plan(

)

## validate data
bat_validation <-  tar_plan(

)


## make report

bat_report <- tar_plan(
  tarchetypes::tar_render(...)
)

```

---

# Loading data 
- Straight forward with local data
- More complicated with [cloud hosted data](https://airtable.com/apps4rtLTXjRQHIvY/tblArZCjsYtZr2LEh/viwcs3ZSXjugmPk7v?blocks=hide)

```
bat_data <- tar_plan(
  targets::tar_target(bat_data_file, "bat_data.csv",format = "file"),
  targets::tar_target(bat_data,read.csv(bat_data_file))


## will targets to be able to detect changes in the data on airtable?

  targets::tar_target(bat_data_airtable, get_bat_data(base = "apps4rtLTXjRQHIvY", table = "bats"))
)
```

???

Ask Noam/Nathan how they deal with this
---

# Validating data
- usethis::use_r("validate_bat_data")

```
## validate data
bat_validation <-  tar_plan(
  targets::tar_target(validated_data, validate_bat_data(airtable_bat_data, csv_bat_data)
  )
)
```

---

# Creating RMD reports/dashboards
- Use `tarchetypes::tar_render`
- Use calls to `targets::tar_read()` to load objects in rmd

```
## make report

bat_report <- tar_plan(
  tarchetypes::tar_render(bat_validation_report,"reports/bat_validation")
)
```
???

Show dir_tree in example

# Debugging
- Visualize targets graph
- traceback(), debug(function) and undebug(function) from base R
- `tar_meta(fields = "error")`
- `debug(BROKEN_FUNCTION)`
- `tar_make(names = BROKEN_TARGET, callr_function = NULL)`
  - opens a browser window at the function
  you're debugging

# Targets and Github
- Be mindful of whats in your _targets folder
