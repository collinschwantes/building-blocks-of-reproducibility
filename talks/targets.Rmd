## Review from previous talks

**Reproducibility** is the ability to re-create results from the same data and code

1)  Use an IDE like Rstudio   
2)  Always start from a blank slate (save source not sessions)  
3)  Use projects and relative paths  
4)  Keep your code organized (avoid spaghetti code)  
5)  Leave yourself notes (literate programming) 
6)  Use a version control system

## Briefest Review of Targets
- Aim is to make analysis workflows more reproducible
- Create a set of steps and execute them
- targets = nouns and functions = verbs
- Outputs are stored and only re-written if something changes 
-  See Noam's talk

## Targets and reproducibility

- Targets allows us to follow the spirit of saving source while keeping some components of our session
- Provides a common structure for projects
  - Functions in an /R folder, packages.R, and _targets.R
- Reduces the amount of documentation needed to execute the code
